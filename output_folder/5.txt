ALJ: Good morning, this is Administrative Law Judge Evie McCullough presiding over the matter of claimant Olin Waters. It's currently 8 o'clock AM sharp here at our office. However, I'm informed that we've actually been in session for a bit longer than that - about four hours later, to be exact. Claimant's Social Security number is 208-54-9959 on record. We're conducting this hearing via video conference, and the claimant is accompanied by their attorney Garry Moen- Simonis today. As you are aware, claimant, you are entitled to appear in person at any time during these proceedings. We've also assembled a panel of expert witnesses for your case, including medical expert Dr. Dena Legros - who I understand has a fascinating hobby of competitive sailing on her downtime - and vocational expert Bernita Kutch. Now, with that said, Mr. Moen-Simonis, would you like to proceed immediately or take some time to review the claimant's file?
ATTY: We'll proceed now.
ALJ: Very well then, Mr. Moen-Simonis indicates that he's
CLMT: I'm comfortable proceeding via video conference as we've been doing.
ALJ: Okay then, I'd just like to confirm that the claimant is indeed comfortable proceeding with the video conference setup as we've been doing so far today. So, to reiterate, it's confirmed then that we'll be continuing on this course of action for now. Yes, just to make it clear again - we're good with where we are currently in terms of format. Alright, moving right, along here.... We do have the resumes and background information for our expert witnesses available if needed at any point during the proceedings. Specifically, I'd like to mention that Dr. Dena Legros, who's a medical expert in her field, has an impressive resume, as does Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert - both of whom bring considerable experience and expertise to their respective areas of specialization. Mr. Moen-Simonis, before we proceed any further,
ATTY: Your Honor, with respect to the matter of expert witness resumes, we've reviewed them thoroughly and I believe they're complete and accurate. As for any additional documentation from the claimant's file, I'd like to confirm that our record is fully developed at this point in time, without need for further Supplementation or revision prior to next Wednesday's scheduled hearing time.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Moen-Simonis, for confirming that the expert witness resumes are complete and accurate. I also accept your assertion that our record is fully developed at this point in time, without need for further supplementation or revision prior to next Wednesday's scheduled hearing time. With that settled, I'd like to proceed with admitting all exhibits from 1A down to exhibit number 27-C into the record as part of these proceedings.
ALJ: Now, let's take a moment to discuss the matter of exhibits, specifically those related to the claimant's medical history and treatment plan - I believe we've reviewed them thoroughly, but there does appear to be some inconsistency in regards to dates, as listed on page 12 versus page 27-C, if you could just confirm that for me, Mr. Moen-Simonis... I mean, it seems quite possible that there might need to be an amendment made
ATTY: Yes, I believe there is an inconsistency regarding dates between page 12 and page 27-C. Specifically, it appears that the date of a certain treatment session on page 12 lists the month as 'June,' whereas page 27-C indicates the correct month should be "July.' We concur with your observation, Your Honor, and we Suggest that the amendment be made to reflect the corrected date on page 27-C, which accurately reflects the claimant's treatment plan.
ALJ: I understand that there's an inconsistency regarding dates between page 12 and page 27-C, specifically concerning a treatment session date listed as 'June' on page 12 versus ‘'July' on page 27-C. Mr. Moen-Simonis, I accept your suggestion to amend the record to reflect the corrected date on page 27-C, which accurately reflects the claimant's treatment plan. Claimant Waters, are you aware that even if we do decide in your favor on this matter, there may be future implications or consequences associated with the amendment of our record, specifically regarding potential discrepancies or inaccuracies in other areas?
CLMT: Yes, I'm aware of that possibility.
ALJ: I want to commend you, Claimant Waters, for sharing such a vivid and detailed account of your experiences with neuropathy and its impact on your daily life. I must say that I'm struck by the intensity of the pain you've described, as well as the numbing and tingling sensations in your legs. It's clear that this condition is not just €@ Minor inconvenience, but rather a debilitating and chronic issue that affects nearly every aspect of your being. I understand now that it's not just about managing your blood sugar levels, but rather an underlying problem with your nerves and circulation that requires specialized treatment
ATTY: I'd like to clarify that the medical records provided by Claimant Waters' treating physician do indicate clinical findings of nerve damage and deterioration related to his blood sugar levels. Furthermore, our vocational expert has prepared a report outlining the substantial limitations imposed on Claimant Waters' ability to perform any substantial gainful activity due to his neuropathy and diabetes diagnosis. We'd like to request permission to enter these documents into the record.
ALJ: Thank you, Attorney. It appears that we do have medical records indicating nerve damage and deterioration related to Claimant Waters' blood sugar levels. I'd like to request that he elaborate on one specific symptom he mentioned earlier - the feeling of ‘walking on pins and needles.' Can you tell me more
ATTY: I'd like to clarify that while Lyrica was indeed prescribed first, it's my understanding that Neuraxin was actually started in January of this year, not March, as a complementary treatment to help manage the residual neuropathy symptoms. Additionally, our medical records indicate that Claimant Waters' treating physician also added gabapentin to his regimen in April to further address his pain management needs. I'd like to request that we clarify and correct “this record to ensure an accurate account of Claimant Waters' treatment plan.
ALJ: I will take note of the correction and clarification regarding Claimant Waters' treatment plan, including the addition of gabapentin to his regimen in April this year. I'd like you now to elaborate on how these medications have affected your neuropathy symptoms, specifically any changes or improvements you've noticed since starting Neuraxin and the addition of gabapentin.
CLMT: Yes, my hands are also affected with numbness and tingling.
ALJ: Benefits are not offset by past tax contributions.
ATTY: I acknowledge the clarification regarding Claimant Waters' tax contributions, and I appreciate the ALJ's consideration of the nuances surrounding his neuropathy symptoms and treatment plan. Decision rendered today confirms that Claimant Waters is entitled to benefits due to his severe impairments.
ALJ: Case closed.
ATTY: The SSA will consider all relevant tax quarters for Claimant Waters' self-employment as a carpenter, including Ql, Q2, and 04 of 2018.
ALJ: Yes, all relevant tax quarters for Claimant Waters' self-employment as a carpenter will be considered, including Ql, O02, and @4 of 2018. The SSA will recalculate his benefits using the correct tax quarters to avoid overpayment penalties.
ATTY: Benefits recalculated with correct. tax quarters, avoiding overpayment penalties.
ALJ: What are the correct tax quarters for Claimant Waters' self-employment as a carpenter?
ATTY: Ol, and 02 of 2018, as previously discussed.
ALJ: Will Q3 of 2018 also be included in the recalculated benefits?
ATTY: Yes. 03 “of* 2018 will also “be included win. Ehe recalculated benefits to accurately reflect Claimant Waters' self- employment earnings as a carpenter.
ATTY: The correct tax quarters for Claimant Waters' self-
ALJ: Thank you, Claimant, for your cooperation throughout thie process. I'd like to thankeDr. Dena legros tor. their expertise and extensive background in orthopedic medicine, as seen on their impressive resume, which can be viewed online at our website under 'Expert Witness Profiles.' Dr. Legros has over 15 years of experience and a proven track record of providing accurate assessments and opinions in complex medical cases like this one. I'd now like to ask Counsel if you have any objections to the medical expert's participation in this case.
ATTY: [INAUDIBLE] objections.
ATTY: I'd “lake “to ¢€larity that Or. -legros =has . .adeed reviewed Claimant Waters' case and is an expert in musculoskeletal conditions related to carpentry work. However, she noted that there's a lack of concrete evidence supporting the claimant's assertion that his back problems are directly related to his job as a carpenter. Specifically, she mentioned that there's no documentation from a treating physician or medical records showing a clear progression of symptoms over time.
ALJ: Acknowledged lack of concrete evidence supporting claimant's assertion.
ATTY: I'm Garry Moen-Simonis, Attorney for Claimant Waters.
ATTY: Dre Leqros, I'd “like to clarify that» when you mentioned a lack of concrete evidence supporting Claimant Waters' assertion regarding his back problems being directly related to his job as a carpenter, are you implying that perhaps his condition could be more accurately described as an exacerbation or manifestation of a pre-existing condition rather than a direct result of his work?
ATTY: I see. So, Dr. Legros, you're saying that the lack of concrete evidence makes it difficult to determine whether Claimant Waters' back problems are directly related to his work as a carpenter or if they may be an exacerbation or manifestation of a pre-existing condition. Can you elaborate on what specific types of documentation or medical records would be necessary to clarify this issue and support or refute the claimant's assertion?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, if such documentation is lacking, can we infer that the claimant's work as a carpenter may not be a Significant contributing factor to his current condition?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, you're saying that without more evidence, it's hard to say for certain whether the claimant's work as a carpenter is a significant contributing factor to his current condition. But, af .E'm hearing youecorrectly, you'tre leaning towards the idea that maybe, possibly, probably not, but we can't be entirely sure because there just isn't enough evidence to Support this assertion. Am I right in Saying that it's a bit of a gray area here, and we'd need more concrete proof to make any kind of definitive statement?
ATTY: Des Legros, I'd dike “to: clarify something else
ATTY: So, Dr. Legros, it seems we've reached a bit of an impasse here. On one hand, Claimant Waters asserts that his job as a carpenter caused his current back problems, but on the other
ATTY: I understand that you're trying to remain impartial and objective, Dr. Legros. However, I must press on here because it's my duty as the claimant's attorney to ensure that his rights are being fairly represented. You mentioned that the claimant may genuinely believe his job caused his back problems despite the lack o£ evidence... But don"t you think it's curious that this condition only manifests itself after years of work as a carpenter, and not before or during other periods of his life? Doesn't that suggest to you that there might be other factors at play here?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I'd like to explore this further. Given that the claimant's condition appears to only manifest itself after years of work as a carpenter, and not before or during other periods of his life, doesn't it seem plausible that perhaps there are other factors at play here? Such as, for instance, a pre- existing condition that was exacerbated by his work duties? Or maybe even a change in job environment or work habits that could have contributed to this condition?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, it seems to me that we're dealing with a complex situation here, and it's imperative that we get to the bottom of this. Given your expert opinion that the claimant's assertion is unsubstantiated, and considering the potential for pre- existing conditions or changes in job environment to be contributing factors, I'd like to ask: Do you believe that further investigation into the claimant's medical history, including any potential pre-existing conditions, would be a prudent step in determining the validity of his claim?
ATTY: I'm satisfied that we've explored all avenues of discussion regarding the claimant's assertion and potential
ATTY: Thank you for explaining the X-ray report from 2018, Doctor. However, I'd like to clarify that this information doesn't necessarily preclude the possibility of a work- related injury contributing to the claimant's current condition. In fact, it seems to me that the degenerative changes in the lumbar spine could be exacerbated by the claimant's prolonged exposure to heavy lifting and bending as a carpenter. I'd like to request further elarification. on» this point.
ALJ: Based on the testimony from both Doctor and the
ATTY: I'd like to clarify that while the vocational expert testified that office cleaning may be feasible for the claimant, Doctor Legros noted that the claimant's chronic lower back pain is likely exacerbated by prolonged standing and sitting. I believe this contradiction should be considered in our assessment.
ALJ: Okay, I think we've covered all the essential points regarding the claimant's employability and his residual functional capacity. We've discussed his chronic lower back”” pain, incontinence issue, use of a wheelchair, and occasional episodes of numbness and tingling in his legs. Given these factors, it appears that jobs with lighter lifting requirements, such as office cleaning, are unlikely for him to perform. Similarly, data entry clerk positions are also not feasible due to the need for frequent movement and adjustments to prevent exacerbation of symptoms. We've also established that bus driving is out of the question due to his chronic lower back pain and incontinence issue. I'd like to thank Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert, for her insightful testimony and assistance in this matter. Now, before we conclude, do you have any final remarks or comments regarding your employability or residual functional capacity?
CLMT: Thank you, thank you so much for listening to my testimony and considering my case. I just want to say that being disabled is not something to be ashamed of or stigmatized. It's a reality that affects millions of people in this country, and we
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Claimant, for sharing your powerful testimony and perspective on disability and inclusion. I appreciate your resilience and determination. Thank you also to Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert, for her insightful analysis
CLMT: Thank you for listening and considering my case. I appreciate your time and understanding.
ATTY: I'd like to know if there are any other jobs that might be feasible for the claimant given his limitations.
