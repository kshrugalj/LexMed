ALJ: Vaughn Heidenreich
ATTY: Brendon Senger
ALJ: Okay, let me make sure I understand this correctly... Mr. Senger is saying that we need to clarify some points regarding the claimant's work history and their alleged disabilities. Is that correct, Attorney?
CLMT: . Yes; I'd like to clarify those points directly.
ALJ: Yes, we can certainly clarify those points directly with you, claimant. I want to make sure we're on the same page here. Just to confirm, you'd like to discuss your work history and alleged disabilities further, is, “EHSL.” correct? Okay, werll definitely take that into consideration.
ATTY: Your Honor, I'd like to state for the record that my client's file is fully developed and no additional evidence is necessary to proceed with the claim. We're ready to move forward with the discussion regarding their work history and alleged
ALJ: Thank you, Attorney Senger, for stating that on the recora.. I contiur with you that the Claimants, file is fully developed and no additional evidence is necessary to proceed at this time. I'd like to admit Exhibits 1A through 12E into evidence without objection, as they have been previously submitted by both parties in good faith.
ALJ: Now, let me just clarify one thing before we proceed any further with this discussion regarding the claimant's work history and alleged disabilities. I've taken a look at the record, and it appears that there may be an inconsistency in regards to the claimant's testimony provided during the initial hearing versus their written statement submitted later on. It seems to me that there might have been some discrepancies in their account of events, if you will, and I'd like to get to the bottom of this so we can make sure everything is crystal clear here. Now, I want to ask both parties to take a close look at this particular section of the record, and see if they can shed any light on what might be causing this discrepancy. Is it possible that there may have been some mistake or oversight in the transcription process, perhaps? If so, we might need to amend certain parts of the record to reflect the accurate information. I mean, we want to make sure everything is as clear and concise as possible, don't we? So, if I'm understanding this correctly, it seems like we may have an
ATTY: Yes, ALJ, I believe there is an inconsistency in my client's testimony, and I agree that it needs to be amended. Upon reviewing the record, it appears that a transcription error occurred during the initial hearing, resulting in an incorrect representation of my client's account of events. Specifically, Exhibit 7C indicates that my client stated they were employed at XYZ Corporation from January 2018 to June 2020, whereas their written statement submitted later on indicates they actually worked there from February 2019 to August 2021. I recommend amending the record to reflect the accurate information as stated in the written statement, which is Exhibit 12B, page 3, lines 2-5. Additionally, I suggest re-transcribing the relevant section of the initial hearing to accurately capture my client's testimony.
ALJ: Thank you, Attorney Senger, for bringing this to our attention and recommending an amendment to the record. MI understand that a transcription error occurred during the initial hearing, resulting in an inconsistency between my client's testimony and their written statement. It appears that the correct information is stated in Exhibit 12238, page 3, Tanes 2-5, which indicates that the claimant was employed at XYZ Corporation from February 2019 to August 2021. I agree that this amendment should be made to the record to reflect the accurate information.
CLMT: I'd like to clarify that I actually started working at XYZ Corporation in February 2019 and it's correct that my
ALJ: Yes, I understand exactly what you mean by that "constant fog rolling in over me', Ms. Schaden. It sounds like a very apt description of the debilitating effects of your migraines on your daily life. You've described the pain, nausea, sensitivity to light, and communication difficulties associated with these episodes, which are all extremely consistent with what we've heard from other claimants who have suffered from similar conditions. I want to assure you that we take your testimony very seriously and wills, @ereftully.” consider” it as ‘part. of our devaluation, for disability benefits.
ATTY. As we Continue With this case, Ld, like to-clarify that my migraines are not just a minor nuisance but a severe and debilitating condition that significantly impacts my ability to work. The pain, nausea, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and communication difficulties associated with these episodes make it
ATTY: i“d dike t6 clarify that while’ Migravex and Rizatriptan did provide some relief from my migraine symptoms, they were not consistently effective in completely eliminating them. I would often experience breakthrough headaches even when taking these medications as prescribed.
ALJ: I understand that neither Migravex nor Rizatriptan provided consistently effective relief from your migraine symptoms, and you often experienced breakthrough headaches even when taking these medications as prescribed.
CLMT: The numbness started around May 2022, but I didn't think it was related to my migraines.
ALJ: I acknowledge that you're currently living with a family member due to your migraines and it's considered long-term but temporary for now.
ALJ: I acknowledge that the evidence supports the conclusion that your migraines and blurred vision significantly limit your ability to drive, work, and live independently.
ATTY: Based on the evidence, I believe a finding of fully disabled and entitled to benefits is warranted.
ALJ: Eta Vike -£6. clartfy = that” Dr. ~Patel’s testimony confirms that you're unable to perform even simple tasks due to migraines and blurred vision, and this establishes that you've been unable to engage in substantial gainful activity for 12 consecutive months, correct?
ALJ: Were these hospitalizations due to migraines
ATTY: General migraine episodes.
ALJ: You stated that Dr. Patel concluded you're unable to work due to lack of effective treatment options; can you clarify what specific treatments were deemed ineffective?
ATTY: I've tried over 20 different medications, including topiramate and botox injections.
ALJ: I'd like to thank you for being open and honest about your experiences with migraines and blurred vision. Dr. Enola Klocko's testimony provided a valuable insight into the severity of your condition. If anyone would like to review Dr. Klocko's impressive background, including her extensive experience in neurology and pain management, it can be found on our website
ATTY: Dr. Klocko, while I appreciate your suggestions for
ALJ: Specifically, how would vision therapy address blurred vision?
ATTY: Dr. Klocko, I'm Attorney Johnson. As I understand it, vision therapy would help improve visual processing skills to reduce blurred vision episodes. Is that correct?
ATTY: Would consistent adherence to prescribed medications and regular eye exams necessarily preclude a finding of disability?
ATTY: Dr. Klocko, you mentioned that Dr. Patel's conclusion was based on my extensive medical history and lack of effective treatment options. Could it be argued that the Claimant's inconsistent adherence to medication regimen is a contributing factor to their migraines, father than an indication. of ineffective treatment?
ATTY: If inconsistent medication adherence can lead to increased migraines, wouldn't it undermine Dr. Patel's conclusion of ineffective treatment options?
ATTY: Dr. Klocko, wouldn't it also suggest that there's a need for more rigorous and ongoing monitoring of the Claimant's medication regimen, possibly even incorporating some sort of pill box or reminder system to ensure they're taking their medications as prescribed, in order to prevent these potential adverse effects and get a clearer picture of how well they're responding to treatment? And perhaps, given the complexity of their case, it might be beneficial to have a multidisciplinary team, including specialists in both neurology and optometry, working together to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses all aspects of their condition, rather than just focusing on one particular aspect or intervention?
ATTY: Dr. Klocke, LF think 1e¢"s also worth ‘considering, that if the Claimant is not adhering to their medication regimen consistently, it could potentially lead to a buildup of tolerance or even an increase in migraine frequency over time. Wouldn't you agree that it's essential to get to the root cause of this inconsistent adherence and address it head-on before we can begin
ATTY: I mean, “think: about at, Dr.: Klocko,” if they"re not taking their medications as prescribed, how can we possibly expect them to respond favorably to the treatments we recommend? It's just common sense, right? I mean, it's not like we're trying to fix a car with a flat tire and no gas in the tank, but that's kind of what this situation feels like. So, let me ask you, Dr. Kiocko,; have you ever seen a case where someone's migraines just seemed to get worse and worse despite all sorts of treatments? I mean, it's like they're running on a hamster wheel or something, getting nowhere fast.
ATTY: I think we've adequately explored the complexities of this case, Dr. Klocko. I'd like to thank you for your thorough and insightful testimony.
ATTY: Based on Dr. Klocko's testimony and Exhibit B, it appears that the Claimant's rapid vision deterioration may indicate an underlying condition that requires further investigation. I agree that inconsistent medication adherence could contribute to this issue, as well as their migraines. The interaction between triptans and beta blockers, combined with fluctuations in blood pressure due to inconsistent adherence, could exacerbate symptoms.
ALJ: Based on VE's testimony, it appears that while Profile 2 may be a viable option for the Claimant, their medical condition caused by the interaction between triptans and beta blockers continues to affect their ability to perform physical tasks. This raises concerns about the Claimant's ability to maintain full-time employment in a physically demanding role like grounds maintenance worker. I'd like to inquire if Counsel has any questions for VE or would like to proceed with closing statements.
ATTY: Based on VE's testimony, it seems that Profile 2 may not be as viable for the Claimant due to their continued physical limitations caused by medication interaction. Can we discuss potential accommodations or modifications to this role to make it more suitable for the Claimant?
ALJ: Thank you, VE Heathcote-Gutmann, for your thorough and insightful testimony. It's clear that the Claimant's medical condition caused by medication interaction presents significant challenges to their ability to perform physically demanding tasks and maintain full-time employment in a role like Profile 2. I'd like to turn our attention to the Claimant now. Please state any
CLMT: I'd like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to everyone involved in this process for their hard work and dedication. I've been advocating for myself and my needs for far too long, and it's a relief to finally have my voice heard. want to “assure you “that “my: disability “15 Mor oiIst” 4 medical condition, but a fundamental aspect of who I am as an individual. It's what drives me to be creative, empathetic, and resilient an the face of adversity... not 7ust fighting tor accommodations or modifications; I'm fighting for understanding, acceptance, and equality. My blurred vision may make it difficult for me to inspect plants or perform visual checks, but it also allows me to see the world from a unique perspective. My inconsistent medication adherence may cause fluctuations in blood pressure, but it also teaches me to be adaptable, flexible, and resourceful. I'm not asking for special treatment; I'm asking for equal access to opportunities and resources that will enable me to thrive in my own way. I'm proud to be a disabled individual, and I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to do the same. We are not broken or flawed; we are diverse, capable, and deserving of respect and inclusion. So, let us rise above our limitations and push for a world that values diversity in all its forms. A world where every individual, regardless of their
ALJ: I'd like to thank the Claimant for their powerful and moving testimony. VE Heathcote- Gutmann, Counsel, and all other experts, I extend my gratitude to each of you for your dedication and expertise throughout this hearing. With that, this meeting is adjourned.
CLMT: Thank you for hearing me out.
ATTY: Thank you, Your Honor, for considering my client's unique situation. I believe this proceeding has shed light on the importance of individualized assessments and accommodations for individuals with complex medical conditions.
