ALJ: Good morning, I'm Administrative Law Judge Alta Green, and we're currently at 10:30 AM on this date. However, as per our schedule, we should have started at 6:30 PM last night. For the record, the claimant's name is Brayan Schmidt, with a Social Security number of 509-48-7448. He has joined us via video conference and is accompanied by his attorney, Roy Metz. I want to remind Mr. Schmidt that he is entitled to have this hearing in- person, and we would be happy to accommodate him if he so chooses. We also have two expert witnesses today: Joshuah Emmerich, a medical expert who has a Ph.D. in neurology from the University of Chicago; and Elton Halvorson, our vocational expert, who has over 15 years of experience working with disabled individuals. Mr. Metz, are you prepared to proceed?
ATTY: Yes; we are ready to proceed.
CLMT: I'm comfortable proceeding as is.
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Schmidt, I"ve got that noted down. You're comfortable proceeding with the video conference hearing as is. Okay, moving right along here. We have all of your records and evidence in front of us. Just to reiterate, Mr. Schmidt, you are the claimant in this case, and we're currently going over the details surrounding your disability claim. As I was saying, we have the resumes of both our vocational expert, Elton Halvorson, who has a vast amount of experience working with disabled individuals, as well as Joshuah Emmerich, our medical expert, who holds a Ph.D. in neurology from the University of Chicago. Before we move forward, I'd like to ask Mr. Metz, is there anything else you"d ike to collect or bring to light at this time? Maybe some additional evidence or statements that might be relevant to the case?
ATTY: I think we're all set, Your Honor. We've reviewed the
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Metz. I've got that noted down. You're satisfied with the record as it stands. Moving right along here. I'd like to admit all of the exhibits listed in 1A down to exhibit number 27-D, and include them into evidence. This will be considered part of our official hearing record. The exhibits will be marked accordingly and filed with the rest of the case documents.
ALJ: Okay, so as I was reviewing the records, I noticed something that seems to be a bit of an inconsistency here. Now, im not envarely Certain 2f this is just, an error on my part or at it's actually a discrepancy within the record itself. However, after staking another ,look “at (it, -I” think. it might» be worth bringing up. You see, there are some dates listed for various medical appointments and procedures that don't quite add up to me. Now, I'm no expert, but it appears as though there may have been some overlap in scheduling, or perhaps even a mistake with the Gaves: themselves. If I recall correctly, we had previously discussed this possibility, but it wasn't entirely clear at the time. I want to make sure that everything is accurate and on the up-and-up, so if that's correct, that there might be an error in the record, then we may need to... Ah, yes, amend it accordingly.
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Metz. I understand that you'd like to amend exhibits 12-C and 15-A to reflect the correct dates of treatment at Mercy General Hospital on January 10th and February 20th, respectively. And also update exhibit 21-D with a revised chart showing the corrected schedule for Mr. Schmidt's physical therapy sessions. I'll go ahead and note that you'd like to make these amendments. Mr. Schmidt, are you aware of the possibility that amending these exhibits could potentially impact the overall timeline of your claim? And if the decision were favorable, would it change any subsequent dates or deadlines that might be relevant to your case?
CLMT: Yes, I was aware that correcting these dates might impact my timeline.
ALJ: I understand, Mr. Schmidt, that correcting these dates might impact your timeline. I'm going to go ahead and note this down for the record. I believe that's understood by all parties
ALJ: Yes, I see what you mean now, Mr. Schmidt, about how those migraines are affecting you, and not just the physical pain itself, but also that fatigue that's always lingering in the background, making everyday tasks feel like a chore. It sounds like it's really impacting your quality of life. You mentioned
ALJ: I'd like to review the medical records provided by Dr. Patel. Can you elaborate on the severity of the fatigue you experience between migraines? Do you find yourself needing frequent rest periods throughout the day or are there specific tasks that leave you feeling exhausted?
ATTY: Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Claimant. It seems there was an error on the record regarding the Neuroxan treatment. To correct this, Dr. Patel's notes actually indicate that she Prescribed Fioricet Starting” January l0th, and it's likely that the mention of Neuroxan was a clerical mistake. As for concurrent use, I believe the records show that you were taking Fioricet as directed during the period in question. To further address any confusion, Dr. Patel herself stated on February 2nd that ‘Fioricet has been effective in managing her migraines and reducing their frequency and severity.' This suggests that she intended for you to use Fioricet consistently throughout this period, not Neuroxan.
ALJ: I've taken note of the clarification regarding the medication regimen. It appears that there was an error on the record noting the use of 'Neuroxan' on January 15th, and Dr. Patel's notes actually indicate that she prescribed 'Fioricet' starting January 10th. The records also suggest that you were taking Fioricet as directed during this period, with Dr. Patel stating on February 2nd that it was effective in managing your migraines.
CLMT: I wasn't aware my numbness was being documented on February 20th.
ALJ: Any questions from the counsel?
ATTY: Yes, I'd like to clarify that my client's symptoms of numbness and tingling in his left hand are having a significant impact on his daily activities, despite them being intermittent.
ATTY: I'm finished asking questions.
ATTY: Affirmative.
ALJ: You stated Dr. Patel's negligence led to permanent neurological damage and exacerbated my client's existing debilitating fatigue and migraines; did her failure to properly monitor his condition and follow up on potential side effects seal his fate?
ATTY: [ INAUDIBLE]
ALJ: You stated Dr. Patel's negligence led to permanent neurological damage and exacerbated my client's existing debilitating fatigue and migraines; did her use of a fake Social Security number on February 15th directly contribute to this
ATTY: Yes.
ALJ: Attorney, Dr. Patel's use of fake Social Security number on February 15th contributed to permanent neurological damage and exacerbated existing conditions; how did this action directly impact my client's outcome?
ATTY: Dr. Patel's use of fake Social Security number compromised accurate medical records, delaying diagnosis’ and treatment for my client's deteriorating condition.
ALJ: Noted that $3 million is being sought as compensation for damages. I'd like to thank you, Claimant, for your patience and cooperation throughout this hearing. I've taken note of Dr. Joshuah Emmerich's extensive medical expertise in his field, as highlighted on his impressive resume, which can be viewed at my website under 'Hearing Transcripts' section. I'll make sure to review it thoroughly before making a final decision. Counsel, do you have any objections to Dr. Emmerich being appointed as the medical expert in this case?
ATTY: No objections.
ATTY: Your Honder;, <1"d* dake to respectfully clarify afew points regarding Dr. Emmerich's testimony. Specifically, I'd like to point out that while he did mention the claimant's family history of neurological disorders, he failed to account for the fact that these conditions are often genetic and not directly related to the claimant's current symptoms. Furthermore, his Suggestion that the claimant didn't follow recommended dosage instructions for Amitriptyline seems to be a misinterpretation of the evidence presented in the medical records. As_ we've established through testimony and documentation, the claimant did indeed follow the prescribed treatment plan and dosage recommendations. i'd «dike gto tequest Eat Dr. Emmerich's additional suggestions for the claimant's recovery and management be taken into consideration, but with the understanding that they should not be used as a basis for contradicting or mitigating the claimant's assertion of disability.
ALJ: Request granted.
ATTY: Dr. Emmerich, my name is Roy Metzger, and I'm
ATTY: Dr. Emmerich, isn't it true that Amitriptyline's side effects are more likely to exacerbate pre- existing conditions rather than cause new ones?
ATTY: So, Dr. Emmerich, if Amitriptyline's side effects are more likely to exacerbate pre-existing conditions rather than cause new ones, can you explain why you suggested that the claimant's family history of neurological disorders might be a contributing factor to his current symptoms?
ATTY: So, Dr. Emmerich, if Amitriptyline's side effects are more likely to exacerbate pre- existing conditions, and you acknowledged that the claimant had a history of anxiety and depression “prier to taking) the medication, do you think it"s possible that his current symptoms are simply a flare-up of his pre-existing condition?
ATTY: So, Dr. Emmerich, if it's entirely possible that the claimant's current symptoms are a flare-up of his pre-existing condition, doesn't that mean that taking Amitriptyline was merely
ATTY: Well, Dr. Emmerich, it seems that we're back to square one, aren't we? I mean, I thought you were an expert in this field, but it appears that you can't even say with certainty whether the claimant's failure to follow up with his primary care physician had a direct impact on his worsening symptoms. And yet, you still chose to bring it up as a potential factor, didn't you?
ATTY: I appreciate your willingness to revisit and clarify any points that may have been oversimplified or misstated, Dr. Emmerich. I'm satisfied with the testimony provided today.
ATTY: Dr. Emmerich, it seems we've finally established a clear picture of what transpired with the claimant's condition and Amitreperyline use. "Id -like “to ~thank you for your thorough explanations and willingness to revisit and clarify any points that may have been oversimplified or misstated.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Halvorson, for your expert testimony regarding the claimant's abilities to perform as a Musician in various settings. Based on your assessment, it appears that the claimant can perform the demands of Profile 2: Musician with Ensemble, but may not be able to perform at the level required by Profile 1: Musician with Orchestra due to the physical and mental demands of leading or conducting an orchestra. Additionally, you stated that the symptom of fatigue experienced by the claimant during their previous work as a Musician is no longer an issue. I would like to ask if Counsel has any questions.
ATTY: [ INAUDIBLE]
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Halvorson, for your thorough and insightful testimony regarding the claimant's abilities to perform as a Musician in various settings, as well as your analysis of their recent difficulties with managing finances, oversleeping, and difficulty waking up for appointments. Your expert opinion will certainly be taken into consideration during my deliberation on this case. I would now like to summarize the key points that have been discussed throughout our hearing today. The claimant's
CLMT: Thank you, Honorable Judge, for allowing me to present my case and share my story with all of you today. I want to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Emmerich, Mr. Halvorson, and the entire team who have worked tirelessly to help me navigate this complex process. I'm not just a musician, I'm a person living with disabilities, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and address these challenges in our society. We must recognize that people like me are capable of so much more than what our limitations may suggest. As I stand before you today, I want to emphasize the importance of compassion, understanding, and empathy towards those who struggle daily with their mental and physical health. It's not just about being disabled; it's about being a part of this beautiful tapestry that we call human experience. We need to break down the stigmas surrounding disability and foster
ALJ: This concludes our hearing today. I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Emmerich and Mr. Halvorson for their expert testimony and dedication to helping claimants navigate this process. To the claimant, I appreciate your courage in sharing your story and advocating for disability awareness and acceptance.
CLMT: Thank you for listening, Honorable Judge.
