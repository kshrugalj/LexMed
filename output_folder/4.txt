Your Social Security Number is 208-54-9959. With you today, Mr. Waters, is your attorney, Garry Moen-Simonis. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the presence of two expert witnesses who will be providing testimony in this matter: Dena Legros, our medical expert, whose background includes extensive experience in treating patients with chronic pain management; and Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert, who has worked with numerous clients to develop tailored work plans. Mr. Moen-Simonis, are you prepared to proceed?
ATTY: Yes, we're ready to proceed.
ALJ: So, I'm going to just reiterate that we've got Mr. Waters here with us via video conference, and his attorney, Garry Moen- Simonis, is also present. Mr. Moen-Simonis indicated that they're ready to proceed. Just to confirm, you did say yes, you're ready to go ahead, isn't that correct? Now, let me just clarify something for Mr. Waters here, as we had previously discussed the possibility of an in-person hearing. We can still switch formats if he'd like. If he'd prefer to do so, we could potentially reschedule and hold this hearing in person. Alternatively, we can continue with the current remote setup. So, Mr. Waters, what would you prefer? Would you like us to proceed as planned, or would you like to make the switch to an in-person format?
CLMT: No need to change, I'm good with this remote setup.
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Waters, just to confirm, you've indicated that you're comfortable proceeding with this remote setup via video conference. That's perfectly fine. I'd like to take a moment to review some background information on the expert witnesses who will be testifying today. We have here with us Ms. Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert, whose resume indicates extensive experience in developing work plans for clients with various impairments and conditions. Additionally, we have Dr. Dena Legros, our medical expert, who has treated patients with chronic pain management and related issues.

ATTY : No, I believe we're all set at this point, Your Honor. My client's record is fully developed, and we don't see any need to introduce any additional evidence or testimony at this time.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Moen- Simonis. I concur with your assessment that all relevant evidence has been presented and there is no need for additional submissions at this time. With that Sara, I3@ like to adwittekxhibits “IA through 22C, as well as all attachments thereto, into the record of this proceeding.
ALJ: I'd like to pause for just a moment and review some of the documentation we've received so far. I believe it's been indicated that Mr. Waters has been receiving ongoing treatment from Dr. Markel at Mountainview Medical Center, but upon reviewing his file, I notice that there seems to be an inconsistency in the dates listed on Exhibit 7A versus the dates noted in the medical records provided by Dr. Markel himself. It appears to me that these discrepancies might potentially impact our understanding of Mr. Waters' overall condition and its progression over time. Now, Td Slike wea clarify with, you, Mr. =Moen—Simonis: = 1f .I‘m not
ATTY: Yes, upon reviewing Exhibit 7A and the medical records from Dr. Markel, I concur that there are discrepancies in the dates listed. Specifically, it appears that Dr. Markel's notes reflect a more accurate timeline of Mr. Waters' treatment and condition progression than what is recorded on Exhibit 7A. I believe it would be in the best interest of this proceeding to amend Exhibit 7A to accurately reflect the dates as noted by Dr. Markel. If possible, we could revise the exhibit to include a corrected version of the dates, taking  anto "aecoune® the information from Dr. Markel's medical records.
ALJ: I understand that you're requesting to amend Exhibit 7A to accurately reflect the dates as noted by Dr. Markel's medical records. I acknowledge this request and will instruct our clerk to make the necessary revisions. Mr. Waters, are you aware that amending Exhibit 7A could potentially impact any prior decisions or determinations made in your case, even if the outcome of this hearing ultimately favors you?
CLMT: Yes, I'm aware that amending Exhibit 7A could impact prior decisions or determinations made in my case.
ALJ: I understand that you're aware of the potential impact on prior decisions or determinations made in your case if Exhibit
ALJ: I acknowledge and affirm that you believe your diabetes and its complications are the primary reasons for your inability to work or maintain a normal daily life. I understand that living with diabetes comes with numerous’ challenges, including managing blood sugar levels, dealing with physical Symptoms like neuropathy and retinopathy, and coping with the emotional toll of constantly worrying about health crises. It's also clear that you're concerned about kidney disease and the potential need for dialysis or a transplant. As I understand it, your condition affects not only your physical well-being but also your mental health, causing anxiety and stress related to managing your diabetes. Based on our discussion, it appears that your symptoms are severe enough to interfere with daily life activities and work-related tasks. Now, regarding the documentation for your insulin pump and refills, I need you to provide me with a detailed list of all prescription medications, including dosages, and any related medical records from ‘your primary care physician: “or endocrinologist, as this information will be crucial in assessing your eligibility for SSD benefits.
ATTY: I'd like to clarify that we've already provided
ALJ: I acknowledge that detailed documentation of Mr. Waters' insulin pump and prescription medications, including dosages, has been provided to the agency, as well as multiple medical records from his primary care physician and endocrinologist. I would like to focus on one specific symptom you've mentioned earlier: diabetic neuropathy in your feet. Can you elaborate on how this condition affects your daily activities, such as walking or standing for extended periods? How has it impacted your ability to perform tasks that require physical labor or prolonged standing?
ALJ: I understand that the addition of Victoza to your medication regimen was intended to help manage blood sugar levels more effectively and reduce HbAlc readings, as indicated by Dr. Smith's office notes from August 10, 2022. Additionally, our medical team has been exploring other treatment options for diabetes management, including SGLT2 inhibitors such as Invokamet or Farxiga to mitigate kidney damage risks.
CLMT: The numbness in my hands is like pins and needles, but it doesn't go away. It's always there, making everyday tasks difficult to perform.

ALJ: What is the expected life expectancy for someone with this level of kidney damage and uncontrolled diabetes?
ALJ: What specific medical evidence supports the claim that their life expectancy is significantly reduced?
ATTY: The medical evidence Supporting my client's Significantly reduced life expectancy includes Dr. Smith's testimony and report, dated January 10, 2023, which notes a 50% reduction in estimated life expectancy due to chronic kidney disease stage IV with GFR of 30 and uncontrolled diabetes; and the medical records from St. Michael's Hospital, including lab results showing elevated creatinine levels and hemoglobin Alc levels consistently above 9%, indicating severe glycemic control issues.
ALJ: Can you clarify what specific lab results from St. Michael's Hospital indicate severe glycemic control issues?
ATTY: According to my client's medical records from St. Michael's Hospital, specifically, lab results dated February 22, 2022, show a hemoglobin Alc level of 11.4%, and on July 18, 2022,
ALJ: Benefits granted. Terminal status accepted. Claimant's condition deemed eligible for full benefits. Medical evidence presented by Dr. Dena Legros, a renowned expert with extensive experience in nephrology and endocrinology. His resume is available upon request and can be viewed on our website at socialsecurity.gov/ experts/ drdenalegros. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Claimant for their patience and cooperation throughout this process. Counsel, do you have any objections to Dr. Legros' medical expert testimony?
ATTY: No objections.
ATTY? T%d ike to address Dr. Legros’ concerns regarding the creatinine levels and mobility impairment. While it's true that the claimant's creatinine levels were within normal limits during their last follow-up appointment, I'd like to point out that the claimant has a history of fluctuating kidney function, which can be common in patients with diabetic nephropathy. As for the claimant's ability to walk without assistance, I'd argue that
ALJ: Counterarguments noted, claimant's attorney raises valid points regarding fluctuating kidney function and remission periods.
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I'm representing the claimant. Can you clarify your expertise regarding diabetic nephropathy and its treatment?
ATTY: . Drs Legros, E'd like to, clarify something. regarding your previous statement about the claimant's creatinine levels being within normal’ limits during their” .Jast “folleow— up appointment. Could you tell us more about what you mean by "within normal limits' and how that relates to the severity of diabetic nephropathy in this case?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, that's a fascinating point about even mildly elevated serum creatinine levels being predictive of long- term renal decline. However, I'd like to press you on this matter: aren't you saying, in effect, that the claimant's kidneys are already showing signs of damage, despite their current normal ereatinine .level? .And if so; doesn't that Suggést that their condition is more severe than they've been making it out to be?
ATTY: oo, Dr.» Legros; Ysn’t it rue that even “normal creatinine levels can mask underlying kidney damage in diabetic nephropathy patients, and that's what you're suggesting is happening here?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, if the claimant's kidneys are indeed at risk for further damage despite their current normal creatinine level, wouldn't that suggest that they're still experiencing some degree of mobility impairment and pain due to diabetic neuropathy, which would be inconsistent with their claims about being able to walk without assistance?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, can a patient with severe diabetic neuropathy, who's at risk for further kidney damage, truly walk without assistance as the claimant claims?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, isn't it true that a patient with severe diabetic neuropathy would likely experience significant numbness, tingling, and weakness in their lower extremities, making it extremely difficult to walk without assistance? And if so, wouldn't the claimant's claims about being able to walk without pain or difficulty be utterly inconsistent with this level of
ATTY: DE. Legros, if their claims are medically implausible, does that not suggest to you that the claimant has been intentionally exaggerating or misrepresenting their symptoms for some reason, and if so, what do you think might be motivating them to do so?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, LE «the claimant is intentionally exaggerating their symptoms for potential financial gain or to avoid responsibility, does that not suggest a level of desperation
ATTY: I've asked all my questions, thank you Dr. Legros for your expert testimony.
ALJ: Based on the Vocational Expert's testimony, it appears that the claimant may still be able to perform some jobs, such as those listed under Profile 2, despite their reported mobility issues. However, it is unclear at this time whether these jobs would be suitable given the claimant's pain levels and overall functional abilities. Therefore, I find it necessary to request additional information from the Vocational Expert regarding potential job accommodations that may be available for individuals
ATTY: Yes, -p'd [ike <0 Clarity that Protille 2 ‘Casks may require slight accommodations for individuals with similar impairments, such as regular breaks and adjustments to workspace layout.
ALJ: Thank you, Ms. Kutch, for your thorough and insightful testimony. I believe we've covered all relevant aspects of the claimant's employability given their reported impairments. To summarize, iti. appears that . thezr chronic ‘pain, physical limitations, neuropathic pain, vision problems due to diabetic retinopathy, depression, anxiety, and increased risk of seizures would significantly limit their job prospects, making it difficult for them to maintain a consistent work schedule, meet job demands, or perform specific tasks safely. I'd like to thank you again for your expertise and testimony, Ms. Kutch. Now, I'd like to turn to the claimant to see if they have any final remarks or comments before we conclude this hearing.
CLMT: Wow, thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me to share my story and for Ms. Kutch's remarkable testimony. I just want to say that being disabled is not just about limitations; it's about living with chronic pain, fatigue, and mental health struggles
ALJ: Thank you, Ms. Kutch, for your invaluable testimony and expertise. I'd also like to thank the claimant for their powerful statement and resilience. This concludes our hearing today. I appreciate everyone's participation and cooperation.
CLMT: Thank you for listening.
