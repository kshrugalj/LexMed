ALJ: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this hearing at 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time. I am Administrative Law Judge Evie McCullough. We are gathered here today to consider the case of Mr. Olin Waters, claimant, who is appearing by video conference from his location, accompanied by his attorney, Mr. Garry Moen-Simonis. I'd like to remind the claimant that he is entitled to an in- person hearing if he so chooses. Now, as we proceed with this case, we have a medical expert, Dr. Dena Legros, who has a Ph.D. in physical therapy and has worked extensively with patients recovering from orthopedic injuries. We also have a vocational expert, Bernita Kutch, who has over 20 years of experience in rehabilitation counseling. Mr. Moen-Simonis, may I ask you if your client's video conferencing equipment is functioning properly?
ATTY: Yes, my equipment is functioning properly.
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Moen-Simonis's video conferencing equipment is functioning properly. Just to confirm that for the
CLMT: I'm comfortable proceeding via video conference as planned.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Waters, for confirming that you're
ATTY: Yes, I believe our record is now fully developed, Your Honor. We've had an opportunity to review all the evidence and medical records submitted by Dr. Legros and Ms. Kutch. In fact, my client has thoroughly reviewed everything that's been provided to us so far. So, we're ready to proceed with the hearing at this time.
ALJ: I acknowledge that the record is now fully developed, and Mr. Moen- Simonis's client has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence and medical records submitted by Dr. Legros and Ms. Kutch. I'd like to admit. Exhibits, 1A through 2E, inclusive of any attachments or addendums thereto.
ALJ: As I've been reviewing the documents submitted by Dr. Legros and Ms. Kutch, it appears that there's an inconsistency in the record regarding Mr. Waters' treatment history at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center. Specifically, Exhibit 1D, the discharge summary from Dr. Legros, indicates that Mr. Waters underwent physical therapy on Tuesdays and Thursdays, whereas Exhibit 2B, the daily log maintained by Ms. Kutch, suggests that his physical therapy sessions occurred on Mondays and Fridays instead. So, I'm wondering if perhaps there's been some kind of mistake or miscommunication somewhere along the line regarding Mr. Waters' actual treatment schedule at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center. If that's correct, then we may need to amend the record accordingly
ATTY: Yes, Your Honor, I agree with your observation regarding the inconsistency in the record. It's clear that there was a mistake in documenting Mr. Waters' treatment schedule at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center. The correct information should reflect physical therapy sessions occurring on Mondays and Fridays, as noted in Exhibit 2B. Therefore, we propose amending Exhibit 1D, the discharge summary from Dr. Legros, to accurately reflect the actual dates of his therapy sessions, which were on Mondays and Fridays, not Tuesdays and Thursdays as previously stated.
ALJ: I understand that Mr. Moen- Simonis and his client agree to amend Exhibit 1D, the discharge summary from Dr. Legros, to accurately reflect the actual dates of Mr. Waters" physical therapy sessions at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center, which were on Mondays and Fridays, not Tuesdays and Thursdays as previously stated. Now, I'd like to direct my attention to you, Mr. Waters. Are you aware that amending this record may have some consequences for your case, even if the decision is ultimately favorable? Do you understand that by correcting this inconsistency, it could potentially impact the weight given to certain pieces of evidence or the overall analysis of your claim?
CLMT: Yes, I'm aware that amending this record may have some consequences for my case.
ALJ: I acknowledge that Mr. Waters understands’ the
ALJ: I understand, Mr. Waters, that you're experiencing Significant difficulties with neuropathy due to your Diabetes with Complications, which affects your daily activities and quality of life. You've mentioned pain and numbness in your feet, making it hard for you to walk or stand for long periods, perform simple tasks like taking a shower, and even concentrate on things for more than a few minutes at a time. I also note that you've been prescribed medication and are monitoring your blood sugar levels Legularly. Based. on © this; I believe that your condition Significantly impacts your ability to perform basic work-related
ATTY: Yes, we will obtain and submit Dr. Legros' detailed medical report outlining Mr. Waters' current treatment plan, including medication, as well as a statement explaining how his neuropathy affects his ability to perform even basic daily activities.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Moen-Simonis. Now, Mr. Waters, I'd like to ask you to elaborate on another symptom that's been reported by Dr. Legros. You've mentioned experiencing 'pins and needles’ sensations in your feet due to the neuropathy. Can you describe what that feels like for you, specifically?
ATTY: I'd like to clarify that while Metformin was indeed prescribed for blood sugar control, Dr. Legros’ note from April 12th does indicate that it can also help alleviate neuropathy symptoms. However, I'd like to offer an explanation from Dr. Legros himself regarding the discrepancy in medication use and purpose. He has stated that while Telprex was discontinued due to
ALJ: I appreciate the clarification provided by your attorney regarding Dr. Legros" note and the role of Metformin in managing both blood sugar levels and neuropathy symptoms. It appears that there was a misunderstanding regarding the purpose of Metformin, but it's clear now that it can have an indirect effect on reducing neuropathy symptoms through its impact on blood sugar control.
CLMT: Those episodes were very painful and made it hard for me to stand or walk.
ALJ: Residual functional capacity assessment was cited as a reason for denial.
ALJ: What is your client's current work status?
ATTY: We've established Mr. Waters" disability through Dr. Patel's electromyogram and his inability to perform physically demanding work as an HVAC technician. I'm done asking questions.
ALJ: Let's summarize some key points before proceeding. Can I get confirmation from the attorney that Mr. Waters' vocational history as an HVAC technician is indeed physically demanding and does not align with sedentary work requirements?
ATTY: Yes, physically demanding.
ALJ: You stated earlier that Dr. Patel's electromyogram confirming severe nerve damage establishes Mr. Waters' disability. Can you clarify what specific job or occupation would still be available to him given his condition and test results?
ATTY : None, considering his electromyogram results and
ALJ: Is Mr. Waters' disability considered total based on his inability to perform any job due to severe nerve damage?
ATTY: Yes, Mr. Waters' disability is considered total due to his severe nerve damage and inability to perform any job as a result.
ALJ: You stated Mr. Waters' disability is considered total. What jobs would he still be capable of performing if his ability to stand and walk for extended periods were temporarily alleviated?
ATTY: With temporary alleviation of his standing and walking limitations, Mr. Waters may still be capable of performing desk jobs that require minimal physical exertion, such as data entry or bookkeeping, but this is speculative given the unpredictable nature of his condition.
ALJ: I'd like to thank you, Mr. Waters, for being open and honest about your condition. Considering all the information presented today, I must reiterate that it's clear your severe nerve damage has significantly impacted your ability to perform any job. I've taken into account Dr. Patel's electromyogram results and your testimony about your daily life. Now, regarding the platelet-rich plasma injections, I'd like to confirm if you're still awaiting an appointment with a specialist, perhaps one who's familiar with this treatment method. You see, I've had the pleasure of reviewing the resume of Dr. Dena Legros, our medical expert in this case, and it's quite impressive. His extensive experience in pain management and neurology is truly remarkable. If you'd like to view his resume for yourself, it can be accessed through the court's website under 'Expert Witness Profiles.' Now, Counselor, I must ask if there are any objections to Dr. Legros serving as our medical expert in this case?
ATTY: No objection.
ATTY: I'd like to address Dr. Legros' expert opinion that there seems to be an incongruity between the claimant's assertions of disability and their ongoing treatment efforts. While it's true that the claimant is awaiting an appointment for platelet- rich plasma injections, I believe this is a reasonable approach given the complexity of their condition and the need for ongoing management. Furthermore, I'd like to point out that the claimant has been experiencing some improvement with this treatment method, which suggests that they are indeed actively seeking relief from their symptoms.
ALJ: I acknowledge Counselor's argument that awaiting platelet-rich plasma injections is a reasonable approach given the complexity of the claimant's condition and ongoing management.
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I'm Garry Moen- Simonis, attorney representing the claimant. I'd like to clarify that the claimant's assertion of disability is not inconsistent with their ongoing treatment efforts.
ATTY: I'm glad we could clear up that point, Dr. Legros. But I must say, I do find it intriguing that you mentioned earlier that the claimant's treatment approach seems 'modest' and not very aggressive in addressing their condition. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that, and whether you think this approach is sufficient to alleviate the claimant's debilitating symptoms?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, if a more comprehensive and aggressive approach is warranted for the claimant's condition, why did you not recommend such an approach in your evaluation?
ATTY: I understand that as an expert medical witness, your role is to provide context and expertise on the claimant's condition. However, I'd like to clarify something you mentioned
ATTY: Dr. Legros, if platelet-rich plasma injections are not addressing the underlying nerve damage and may only provide temporary relief, then how can we explain the claimant's reported improvement with this treatment method?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I appreciate your cautionary approach to attributing the claimant's reported improvement solely to the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma injections. However, don't you think it's a bit disingenuous to suggest that we're dealing with a complex interplay of confounding factors and spontaneous remission
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I understand your caution and willingness to remain uncertain about the efficacy of platelet- rich plasma injections. However, don't you think it's your professional duty as an expert medical witness to provide a more definitive assessment of this treatment modality? After all, aren't you being overly cautious in suggesting that its efficacy is still uncertain when we've seen some reported improvement from the claimant? Can you explain why you're not willing to take a firmer stance on this issue?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I understand your commitment to providing objective and evidence-based assessments. However, don't you think that you're being overly influenced by the limitations of the existing literature when making your assessment? Doesn't it seem reasonable to consider the possibility that platelet-rich plasma injections may have a therapeutic effect on severe nerve damage, even if the current studies are limited in their scope and design?
ATTY: I believe that's all the questions I had for you, Dr. Legros. Thank you for your thoughtful and expert testimony.
ATTY: I'd like to reiterate that the claimant's treatment history is quite complex, and it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how platelet-rich plasma injections were utilized in conjunction with other therapies. However, it does seem clear that the claimant experienced some improvement in symptoms after receiving these injections from Dr. Smith, although not as pronounced as they had been previously at Dr. Lee's clinic. I'd like to request further clarification on whether Dr. Smith was aware of the claimant's prior treatment history and how this may have impacted their decision-making regarding the use of platelet-rich plasma injections in this case.
ALJ: It appears that we have established that Profile 2, driving a smaller school bus for a suburban district, is a job that the claimant could perform with their physical limitations. However, I do want to note that even if they can physically navigate the stairs and uneven surfaces, other factors such as the claimant's chronic pain and limited mobility may still impact their ability to safély operate a school, bus in certain situations. Nevertheless, for now, let us consider this job as an
ALJ: Thank you, Ms. Kutch, for your thorough analysis and insights into the claimant's employability as a dispatcher or
CLMT: Ladies and gentlemen of this esteemed panel, I stand before you today as a testament to the human spirit's unyielding capacity for resilience. Despite being beset on all sides by the merciless onslaught of chronic pain and limited mobility, I have emerged, phoenix-like, from the ashes of adversity. My right leg may be battered and bruised, my nerves frayed like worn-out guitar strings, but my indomitable will shall not be vanquished. For I am a warrior, armed with an unyielding determination to shatter the shackles of disability and forge a new path, one paved with the unbroken spirit of a thousand thousand broken dreams. My experience as a bus driver has taught me that even in the midst of chaos, there lies a hidden beauty, a symmetry waiting to be revealed like the intricate patterns on a butterfly"s wings. I have learned to navigate the treacherous waters of variable shifts and unpredictable schedules with an ease born of desperation, my adaptability honed to a razor's edge by the merciless winds of
ALJ: Thank you, Claimant, for a passionate and poignant statement. I appreciate your candor and resilience in the face of adversity. To Ms. Kutch and all experts who testified today, thank
CLMT: Thank you.
ATTY: No further questions at this time.
