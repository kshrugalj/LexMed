ALJ: Good morning, everyone, I'm Anibal Braun, and it is currently 11:30 AM on this date, however, it appears we are running a bit behind schedule, as I see that it is actually 12:30 PM in regular time. We have Granville Weber, claimant, with us today via video conference, who appeared with his attorney, Walter Block. and i want to take a” moment. to acknowledge that the regulations clearly state that this claimant is entitled to an in- person hearing, and we will certainly do our best to accommodate that request moving forward. We also have two expert witnesses scheduled to appear before us today, Dr. Matilde Lynch, who, as it happens, has written extensively on the topic of occupational therapy and its applications in various fields, and Mr. Domenico Koch, a vocational expert with many years of experience in evaluating job markets and assessing an individual's ability to perform specific tasks. With that said, Mr. Block, can you confirm for me that your client is prepared to proceed today?
ATTY: Yes, my client is ready to proceed.
CLMT: I'm comfortable proceeding with the video conference as planned.
ALJ: Very well, Mr. Weber, I just want to confirm that we're all on the same page here - you've indicated a comfort level with proceeding as planned, which is to say via video conference, and not switching over to an in-person hearing at this time. So, I just want to make sure that's clear for everyone involved. Next, let me review our panel of experts scheduled to appear today - we have Dr. Matilde Lynch on the docket, who has a long history of work in occupational therapy and related fields, as well as Mr. Domenico Koch, who brings a wealth of experience as a vocational expert to the table. As it happens, I've got their respective resumes right here in front of me, and, if I may say so myself,
ATTY: Yes, thank you, your honor. To confirm, my client has already submitted all necessary documentation and evidence, including medical records, employment history, and vocational expert opinions. Our record is fully developed at this point, and I believe there's nothing further that needs to be added or collected prior to the next hearing date.
ALJ: I agree with Mr. Block's assessment that our record is fully developed at this point, so we won't need to collect any additional evidence or documentation prior to the next hearing date. With that established, I'd like to admit all exhibits submitted by the claimant from 1A down through exhibit number 27D, which includes medical records, employment history, vocational expert opinions, and other relevant materials. All of these exhibits are hereby admitted into evidence as part of our proceeding today.
ALJ: Now, I'd like to take a closer look at this vocational expert report from Mr. Domenico Koch - yes, I'm looking right here at Exhibit number 17B - and it seems that there's an inconsistency in the record regarding Mr. Koch's qualifications as a vocational
ALJ: il wundérstand that Mr. Block would like to amend Exhibit 17B to reflect Dr. Lynch's findings and remove references to Mr. Koch's qualifications on this specific topic, substituting Dr. Lynch's report for Mr. Koch's on the matter of vocational
CLMT: Yes, I'm aware of the proposed changes and their potential impact on our proceeding.
ALJ: I'd like to confirm that we're all on the same page here - I understand that you, Mr. Block, are seeking to amend Exhibit 17B to reflect Dr. Lynch's findings and remove references ta) Me. «Roch’s qualifications as a  wocatuonal. expert in occupational therapy. Likewise, I believe it's clear that my client, Mr. Weber, is aware of these proposed changes and their potential impact on our proceeding today. With that established, Leonard Lind, could you please take note of this amendment and reflect it accurately in the record? Now, Mr. Weber, I'd like to begin questioning you directly regarding your claim - I'll be going over various aspects of your case, and I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with any necessary clarifications or information as we proceed.
ALJ: I appreciate the level of detail and candor with which you've described your experiences with extreme fatigue, Mr. Weber. I must say that I have a clear understanding of what you're trying to convey - it sounds like you're struggling with a complex interplay of physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms that are significantly impacting your ability to function in daily life. Specifically, it seems that this condition is affecting your energy levels, sleep patterns, muscle pain, concentration, memory, and multitasking abilities. I'm going to paraphrase what you've said to ensure I understand it correctly: you're experiencing a chronic and debilitating fatigue that's not just physical but also affects your mental state, making it difficult for you to perform even basic tasks or maintain gainful employment. You've described this condition as feeling like ‘autopilot mode' where your brain feels like it's being hit with a ton of bricks every time you try to focus on something. You've also mentioned sleep disturbances, muscle pain, and cognitive difficulties that make everyday life feel like a constant struggle. I understand that you're having trouble quantifying the severity of this condition, but it sounds
ATTY: Yes, I can provide those documents, Your Honor. I'll just need a moment to gather them from my files.
ALJ: Very well, Attorney. While we wait for those documents, I'd like to ask Mr. Weber to elaborate on his experience with muscle pain. You mentioned earlier that it feels like your entire body aches from head to toe. Can you describe what that feels like in more detail? Is there anything specific that triggers or alleviates the pain?
ATTY: If I may clarify for the record, Mr. Weber started taking Amitriptyline about 6 months before seeing Dr. Lee on January 10th. However, he had to stop taking it due to side effects of increased anxiety and overwhelmed feelings. In response to your question, Your Honor, we can confirm that Mr. Weber was prescribed Nexalon by Dr. Lee on January 10th for his chronic muscle pain and spasms.
ALJ: I've taken note of the clarifications provided by Mr. Weber and his attorney regarding his medication history, particularly with regards to Amitriptyline and Nexalon. It appears that Mr. Weber started taking Amitriptyline approximately 6 months before seeing Dr. Lee on January 10th but had to discontinue it due to increased anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed. He was subsequently prescribed Nexalon by Dr. Lee on January 10th for his chronic muscle pain and spasms.
CLMT: I've been experiencing numbness in my hands for a few months now, it's intermittent but really affects my ability to perform even simple tasks.
ALJ: I acknowledge that you see a therapist every other week to manage your anxiety.
ATTY: I acknowledge that my client experiences debilitating muscle spasms daily, multiple times a day, severely impacting self-care tasks and exacerbating his anxiety, which he manages with therapy sessions every other week. His condition has rendered him unable to work or engage in daily activities due to chronic pain, numbness, and fatigue.
ALJ: I acknowledge my client's severe condition rendering
ATTY: I've exhausted all inquiries regarding Mr. Weber's case.
ALJ: Thank you, counsel for your comprehensive presentation. Before we conclude, I'd like to clarify that Mr. Weber's condition is indeed permanent and irreversible, as stated by Dr. Lee's report. This would mean he has been at a plateau Since 2019 with no signs of improvement or recovery. We will take this into consideration when calculating his retroactive benefits, using the 2020 Social Security Administration Life Expectancy Tables for males born in 1962 to estimate his life expectancy and subsequent monthly benefit amount.
ATTY: I'm ready for the post- hearing submission and any additional steps to expedite Mr. Weber's benefits calculation.
ALJ: Before we proceed with the post-hearing submission, can you confirm that Mr. Weber's waiver for lack of insurance coverage from January to April 2022 will need to be addressed directly with the OHA?
ATTY: Yes
ALJ: You mentioned calculating retroactive benefits starting from January 1st, 2020; does that include accounting for
ATTY: Both partial disability and complete incapacitation.
ALJ: You're stating that Mr. Weber's retroactive benefits should account for both his partial disability and complete incapacitation; can you confirm that this includes compensation for lost earning capacity from January lst, 2020?
ATTY: Yes, retroactive benefits should include compensation for lost. earning capacity.
ALJ: Thank you, Claimant, for your thorough testimony and for confirming that ongoing medication management will be covered by Medicare. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Dr. Matilde Lynch's expertise in this matter. Her resume is readily available
ATTY: I'd dike to point out «that Dr. Lynch mentioned
ALJ: Dr. Lynch's observations regarding discrepancies between Dr. Lee's report and Claimant's statements, as well as lack of therapy sessions, are relevant to disability status determination.
ATTY: Dr. Lynch, I'm Walter Block, Mr. Weber's attorney.
ATTY: Dr. Lynch, if the minor improvements noted by Dr. Lee were indeed incorrect, wouldn't that directly impact Mr. Weber's disability status?
ATTY: Dr. Lynch, if the minor improvements noted by Dr. Lee were indeed incorrect, wouldn't that directly impact Mr. Weber's disability. status?. And’ if so, 1sSn"t °1t curious that Dr. Lee's report was downplayed in favor of the more recent information provided by the Claimant?
ATTY: Dr. Lynch, can you explain why Mr. Weber's treatment plan doesn't include ongoing therapy sessions when you've testified that they're crucial for managing anxiety disorders?
ATTY: So, Dr. Lynch, it was simply an oversight that Mr. Weber's treatment plan didn't include ongoing therapy sessions? But wouldn*t youw Say that's a bit of “a. critical omission. when we're talking about managing a complex anxiety disorder like Mr. Weber's? I mean, isn't it true that therapy is often just as important as medication in these cases? And aren't there any red flags or warning signs that would suggest this was more than just an oversight on the part of his healthcare provider?
ATTY: »f'd dike to” thank Dre Lyneh for” her.insightful- and thorough testimony. I believe we've shed sufficient light on the issues at hand.
ATTY: I believe we've established a clear picture of Mr. Weber's treatment plan and its shortcomings in addressing his anxiety disorder. The evidence suggests that ongoing therapy sessions are crucial for effective management, and I'm pleased to see the Administrative Law Judge is taking this into consideration.
ALJ: Based on the vocational expert's testimony, it appears that the claimant's anxiety disorder is not causing difficulties with regular attendance and punctuality. The claimant can perform tasks consistent with a Client Support Specialist working for a small software company, providing basic technical support via phone and email to clients with simple issues. With these findings in mind, I would like to ask if Counsel has any questions.
ATTY: Based on Dr. Lynch's testimony about the importance of ongoing therapy sessions in managing Mr. Weber's anxiety
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Koch, for your thorough and insightful testimony. Based on our discussion today, it appears that the
CLMT: Your Honor, esteemed members of this assembly, I stand before you today as a testament to the unrelenting force that is anxiety. A thief in the night, it steals our strength, our confidence, and our ability to face the world with unwavering optimism. But, Your Honor, I implore you to see beyond the facade of productivity and efficiency that society so desperately clings to. I am not a machine, nor am I a broken toy that can be fixed with a few well-placed Band-Aids or a cursory glance from HR. My anxiety is a living, breathing entity that courses through my
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Weber, for sharing your powerful and poignant testimony. Your words have shed light on the complexities of anxiety and its profound impact on individuals.
