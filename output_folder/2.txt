ALJ: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is Administrative Law Judge Kennedi Rutherford presiding over the proceedings today. As we begin, I'd like to note that we're currently at 11:30 hours in the morning on Thursday, March 18th, in accordance with standard US timekeeping. However, if we were to express this in regular English terms, it would be quarter past eleven o'clock in the morning on a Thursday, almost a week from now, which is actually Thursday, March 25th. The claimant, Lorna Schroeder, is present before me today, having appeared in person for these proceedings. Her Social Security number is listed as 384-62-3816. I'd like to acknowledge that she's accompanied by her attorney, Camille Stoltenberg- Kunde. As per the regulations and our agency's policies, Ms Schroeder is entitled to a live hearing today, where we will examine various aspects of her claim in detail. We have assembled an expert panel consisting of Dr Clotilde Ward, who I'm told has published several papers on the
ATTY: Yes, my client is prepared.
ALJ: Okay, I just wanted to reconfirm that Ms Schroeder is indeed prepared to move forward with the hearing as planned. Yes, it seems like we're all set on that point, so let's proceed with Caution here: AS “a “Matter of. fact, Fd “like” t6 ‘take fis opportunity to remind everyone present that today's hearing is actually eligible to be conducted in an alternate format, namely through video conference, if preferred by the claimant. Yes, it's one of those options we have available, and my understanding is that it could potentially allow for a more flexible or convenient arrangement, perhaps even from the comfort of their own home or office, which might be beneficial to Ms Schroeder in this case. r*d like to clarify again that if there were any concerns or wishes on her part to switch to the video conference setting at this late stage, we could actually reset and restart the entire process. Yes, it's an option available to us under these circumstances. So, with all that said, Ms Schroeder, may I ask: do you have a preference for proceeding in person today or would you like to explore the possibility of switching to a video conference arrangement instead?
CLMT: I'm comfortable proceeding as planned, thank you.
ALJ: Very well then, it seems like we're all set and on
ATTY: No, I believe our record is fully developed, Judge. We've reviewed all the relevant evidence and documentation, and nothing further is required at this time.
ALJ: Very well then, Id. dike “to “confirm thet». Ms Stoltenberg- Kunde has indicated that her office believes the
ALJ: Now, as I recall from reviewing this entire matter, it appears there might be a discrepancy within the record itself regarding certain documentation, namely Exhibit 27B and specifically paragraph three of that particular exhibit, which seems to have some inconsistencies with other statements provided earlier in this hearing. If my understanding is correct, then perhaps we may need to revisit this portion of the evidence and possibly even amend or revise it accordingly to ensure accuracy and clarity within the record as a whole. I believe Ms Stoltenberg-Kunde might be able to clarify this point further for me. Yes; that's right. And if that’s correct, then” naturally; we'll need to make some adjustments to reflect these changes accurately.
ATTY? Yes, Judge, I concur with your understanding regarding Exhibit 27B and paragraph three. It appears there's a discrepancy that needs to be addressed. Upon reviewing the evidence, it seems clear that we should revise paragraph three to accurately reflect Ms Schroeder's account of events as documented in Exhibit 23A. The amendment would involve replacing the original statement with the corrected language from Exhibit 23A, which
ALJ: I understand that Ms Stoltenberg-Kunde has agreed to revise paragraph three of Exhibit. 27B to reflect the corrected language from Exhibit 23A, which provides a more accurate account Of Eeventss I'd 1iké to confirm with you, Ms Schroeder, that. you are aware that this amendment may have some implications for your case, even if the decision ultimately is in your favor. Are you aware, Ms Schroeder, that such an amendment could potentially impact any subsequent appeals or administrative proceedings, as it would reflect a change in the original statement?
CLMT: Yes, I understand that revising paragraph three could affect future proceedings.
ALJ: I understand that both Ms Schroeder and her attorney are aware of the potential implications for future proceedings as a result of this amendment. I'd like to direct the attention of Lilly Kertzmann, our hearing reporter, to make note of this revision in the record accordingly. We will now proceed with questioning and answering with Ms Schroeder.
ALJ: I understand that Ms Schroeder is experiencing severe and debilitating symptoms related to her Irritable Bowel Syndrome, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, cramping, anxiety, and stress. These symptoms have a significant impact on her daily life, making it difficult for her to perform even simple tasks, and causing her to feel anxious about when the next episode will occur. I also understand that she has been experiencing these symptoms for an extended period of time, which has taken a toll on her mental health as well. Based on my understanding of Ms
ATTY: The medical records from Dr. Smith are already part of the claimant's file, and we've submitted them as evidence to support her disability claim.
ALJ: I've reviewed the medical records from Dr. Smith, and it appears that Ms Schroeder has been under his care for her Irritable Bowel Syndrome since February 2018. He's documented her symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, and cramping, as well as her treatment plan, which includes medication and lifestyle changes. However, I do have a few questions regarding some of the symptoms you've described, Ms Schroeder. You mentioned experiencing sudden and intense cramping in your stomach when trying to eat or drink something. Can you elaborate on what that's like for you? How often does this happen, and how severe are these cramps?
ATTY: Ms Schroeder mentioned earlier taking Zylotin until March 2020, but later stated it was stopped in May 2020. To clarify, she actually stopped taking Zylotin in February 2020 as previously noted in Dr. Smith's records.
ALJ: I appreciate the clarification from both Ms Schroeder and her attorney regarding the discontinuation of Zylotin. To confirm, Ms Schroeder stopped taking Zylotin in February 2020, as
CLMT: rhe .granulioma. Om my vocal .cords as. another complication of my IBS symptoms.
ALJ: Acknowledged that you tried journaling and deep breathing exercises to manage stress.
ATTY: I acknowledge that Ms Schroeder's IBS symptoms continue to significantly impact her daily life and that she has tried various stress management techniques such as journaling and deep breathing exercises.
ALJ: Noted and acknowledged.
ALJ: Thank you, Attorney. I'd like to clarify a few points regarding vocational rehabilitation. You stated that Dr. Smith's testimony and medical records confirm irreversible electrolyte imbalance, making it not a viable option for Ms. Schroeder. However, can we discuss the possibility of accommodations or modifications in the workplace that might alleviate some of her symptoms?
ATTY: We've explored accommodations and modifications with Dr. Smith, but unfortunately, they would not alleviate her
ALJ: You stated that Dr. Smith's testimony and medical records confirm irreversible electrolyte imbalance making Ms. Schroeder unable to work for at least two years. Can you clarify what specific job duties she would be incapable of performing?
ATTY: All substantial gainful activity.
ALJ: So, all SGAs are beyond her capabilities.
ATTY s. Yes.
ALJ: Did Ms Schroeder's electrolyte imbalance cause her to experience dizziness or lightheadedness?
ATTY: [ INAUDIBLE]
ALJ: Thank you, Ms Schroeder, for being so forthcoming and cooperative throughout this process. I'd like to take a moment to appreciate the expertise provided by Dr. Clotilde Ward, who has an impressive background in gastroenterology, with over 20 years of
ATTY: Dr. Ward's testimony and medical records confirm that Ms Schroeder's electrolyte imbalance renders her incapable of performing even sedentary work. Her persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and inconsistent medication regimen further support this conclusion. Vocational rehabilitation is not a viable option at this time, as it would require addressing the underlying issue of her gastrointestinal condition, which has proven resistant to treatment thus far.
ALJ: Claimant's disability has been established.
ATTY: I'm Camille Stoltenberg- Kunde, representing Ms Schroeder.
ATTY: Then why did Dr. Ward mention inconsistencies in her medication regimen?
ATTY: But didnt Dr. “Ward. diso say ‘that vocational rehabilitation is not a viable option due to her persistent
ATTY: So, Dr. Ward, it seems that we've finally gotten to the crux of the matter. You're saying that, despite her prolonged absence from work and lack of improvement despite various treatment plans, there's still a glimmer of hope that ongoing medical evaluation and adjustments could potentially improve her condition? But isn't it true that this is simply delaying the inevitable, and that we're essentially just kicking the can down the road here? I mean, how many times do you need to reiterate
ATTY: I'll reserve my final remarks for closing arguments. I'm done questioning Dr. Ward.
ATTY Your Juonor, » i'd “dvke “bo, Claritin” that Dr. Wards testimony has indeed shifted towards acknowledging the potential permanency of Ms Schroeder's condition, particularly given the lack of progress despite multiple treatments and adjustments to her medication regimen. I believe this shift in testimony undermines his initial conclusion about the feasibility of vocational rehabilitation, which he now seems to acknowledge is unlikely due to her persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
ALJ: It appears that Ms Schroeder's gastrointestinal symptoms would indeed make tasks such as answering customer inquiries and maintaining inventory difficult for her to perform in a smaller retail pharmacy setting like ABC Pharmacy, despite potential accommodations. I'd now like to inquire if the claimant's Counsel has any questions before we conclude this vocational examination.
ATTY: ‘d4eés
ALJ: Thank you, Vocational Expert Burley Kovacek, for your comprehensive and detailed testimony regarding Ms Schroeder's employability in retail pharmacy settings. I'd like to thank the entire panel of experts and witnesses who have contributed to this hearing. As we conclude, it appears that the evidence presented suggests a high likelihood of permanent disability due to Ms Schroeder's persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and electrolyte imbalance. The vocational expert's testimony has shed light on the
CLMT: Your Honor, esteemed members of this panel, I would like to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the thorough examination and testimony provided by our expert witnesses today. It's clear that they have poured their hearts and souls into understanding the complexities of my conditions, and I am deeply grateful for their dedication. As we stand here today, it is imperative that we acknowledge the very real challenges that I face on a daily basis. My persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and electrolyte imbalance are more than just mere obstacles - they are the unyielding forces that shape my every waking moment. They dictate my availability, my energy levels, and my ability to interact with others. And yet, despite these insurmountable hurdles, I have persevered, I have adapted, and I have continued to push forward with unwavering determination. But let us not be fooled - this is not a story of triumph; it's a testament to the unrelenting struggles that many individuals like me face every Single day. We are not defined by our resilience alone; we are defined by the systemic barriers, the lack of understanding, and the societal stigmas that prevent us from truly living up to our potential. I implore you, honorable members of this panel, to remember that disability is not just a medical condition - it's a
ALJ: Thank you, Ms Schroeder, for your powerful testimony. I'd like to thank all of our expert witnesses and panel members for their dedication and expertise. This hearing is adjourned.
CLMT: Thank you for your time and understanding.
ATTY: Thank you, members of this panel, for a thorough examination of Ms Schroeder's case. I appreciate your dedication to understanding her complex conditions and their impact on her employability. We will continue to advocate for individuals like Ms Schroeder who face significant challenges in finding suitable employment due to persistent health issues.
