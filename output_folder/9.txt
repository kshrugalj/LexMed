ALJ: Good morning, this is Judge Evie McCullough presiding over the matter of claimant Olin Waters' disability benefits appeal, currently scheduled to begin at 8:00 AM, Eastern Standard Time. However, due to some unforeseen delays, we've actually reached that mark already, as it's now 12:00 PM, April 14th, two thousand and twenty-three. Claimant Olin Waters, bearing social security number 208-54-9959, is appearing before me via video conference from his location today, accompanied by his attorney, Garry Moen-Simonis. As per our usual procedures, I want to inform the claimant that he has a right to a hearing in person if he so desires. Before we proceed, I'd like to introduce our panel of experts: medical expert Dr. Dena Legros, who I'm told is an avid fan of historical fiction novels and can often be found reading about 19th-century European monarchies during her spare time; and vocational expert Bernita Kutch, who has extensive experience in evaluating workplace accommodations for individuals with various
ALJ: I must admit I did indeed hear the attorney's affirmative response, Mr. Moen-Simonis, and I want to ensure that it was a clear and unambiguous confirmation, as we're about to dive into the meat of this hearing, so could you perhaps reiterate your readiness to proceed with the current format, or would you like to take just a moment to clarify anything at all, because I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't ensure that everyone's on the same page before moving forward, so please, do tell me how you see things at this juncture.
CLMT: We're ready to proceed as is.
ALJ: Alright then, Mr. Waters, it appears we'ré all in agreement that we can proceed with the current setup, so I'll take note of that and confirm our understanding, to ensure we're on the same wavelength moving forward. As such, I'd like to reiterate that we have a clear understanding about the format of today's hearing, which is via video conference, and we've made it through this initial step without any issues. Now, before we get into the substance of the matter at hand, I'd like to take a moment to introduce some important individuals who will be contributing their expertise during our deliberations. We have the resumes for Dr. Dena Legros, one of our medical experts, as well as Bernita Kutch, our vocational expert, both of whom possess extensive knowledge and experience in their respective fields, which they've
ATTY: Your Honor, I believe we're in a good place with the record being fully developed at this point, and I've had an opportunity to review everything that's been submitted. As such, I don't think there are any outstanding issues or additional documentation that needs to be collected prior to proceeding with today's hearing. Dr. Legros' and Ms. Kutch's resumes have indeed provided valuable context for their areas of expertise, and I'm confident that we can move forward with the substance of Mr. Waters' appeal without any further additions at this time.
ALJ: I concur with Mr. Moen-Simonis' assessment that the record is sufficiently developed at this point and that there are no outstanding issues or additional documentation required prior to proceeding with today's hearing. With that settled, I'd like to note that we have a considerable number of exhibits admitted into evidence as part of this appeal. To confirm, I will admit all exhibits f£rom 1A. through 27F, including but not limited to: all medical records, witness statements, vocational reports, and other
ALJ: Now, as I was saying, or perhaps not, let me clarify this point further by stating it yet again, we've made significant progress thus far and have reached a juncture where we can proceed with the substance of Mr. Waters' appeal, but, uh, wait a minute, hold on just one moment, I think there may be an inconsistency in the “wecord= “that “requires our “sttention; yes indeed, an inconsistency, it seems to me at least, that might necessitate some amendment or perhaps clarification, and so I'm wondering if we could take a brief recess to address this matter further before moving forward, or maybe we can just pause for a moment right here and revisit how we've documented this particular aspect of the Case, ul, uh, £ .thimk @t"s) only fair “that we address -chis discrepancy now rather than later, don't you agree?
ATTY: Yes, I agree with your assessment, your Honor, that there is indeed an inconsistency in the record regarding Exhibit 14B. After reviewing the documentation, it appears that there was an error made by our office when submitting the medical records of Dr. Chen, which included duplicate pages and a missing page from the original report. To correct this discrepancy, I would recommend that we strike the duplicate pages and insert the missing page from the original report, ensuring that Exhibit 14B accurately reflects the complete medical record submitted by Mr.
ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Moen-Simonis, for bringing this to my attention and suggesting a clear path forward to rectify the issue with Exhibit 14B. I understand your recommendation to strike the duplicate pages and insert the missing page from the original report, which aligns with our goal of ensuring an accurate and complete record is presented in this matter. Mr. Waters, are you aware that if we proceed with amending Exhibit 14B as proposed, it may have some bearing on the potential outcomes of your appeal, regardless of whether the decision ultimately favors or rejects your claim?
ALJ: I understand, Mr. Waters, that striking the duplicate pages and inserting the missing page from Exhibit 14B is acceptable to you as it accurately reflects Dr. Chen's medical record submitted in this matter. Similarly, I acknowledge your understanding of this amendment's implications on the potential outcomes of your appeal. Hearing Reporter Reymundo Boyle, please note that we will be amending Exhibit 14B by striking the duplicate pages and inserting the missing page from the original report, as proposed by Mr. Moen-Simonis. Now, let us proceed with the next phase of this hearing, where I will begin questioning you directly, Mr. Waters.
ALJ: I acknowledge and affirm that you're experiencing daily struggles with managing your diabetes-related complications, including high blood sugar levels, neuropathy, retinopathy, and kidney disease. You've described these issues as being persistent and debilitating, making it extremely challenging for you to manage your daily activities, much less focus on work- related tasks. I understand that you believe these conditions combined are the reason why you're disabled and unable to continue working in any way. To confirm my understanding, diabetes- related complications can cause a range of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, pain, and vision problems. These symptoms can make it difficult for individuals with diabetes to perform even simple tasks, let alone more complex work-related activities. I also want to note that you mentioned the kidney disease requiring regular dialysis treatments, which takes up a significant amount of your time. To further assess this claim, I need some medical documentation from you or your treating physician regarding your ongoing treatment plan for diabetes and its related complications. Specifically, I require records detailing your current medications, dosage, and any changes made to your treatment regimen within the past six months. Can your attorney provide me
ATTY: Your Honor, I'd plike to confirm “that my elient, Mz. Waters, is experiencing significant difficulties with managing his diabetes-related complications, including high blood sugar levels, neuropathy, retinopathy, and kidney disease. These symptoms are causing him persistent pain, numbness, tingling, and vision problems, making it extremely challenging for him to perform even simple tasks, let alone work-related activities. I understand the request for medical documentation from my client or his treating physician regarding his ongoing treatment plan for diabetes and its related complications, specifically records detailing current medications, dosage, and any changes made within the past six months. I'll ensure that these documents are provided by the end of the day.
ALJ: I acknowledge and affirm that Mr. Waters' attorney has confirmed his client's experiences with diabetes- related complications, including high blood sugar levels, neuropathy, retinopathy, and kidney disease. I also acknowledge receipt of the agreement to provide medical documentation by the end of the day. Now, Mr. Waters, can you elaborate on what it feels like when your fingers 'tingle' due to the neuropathy? Is this a sensation that comes and goes, or is it persistent throughout the day?
ATTY* Your sHonory, “'d dike to ‘clarify that amy elient cid indeed start taking Lyrica on May 20th of last year as an additional treatment for neuropathic pain, which is a departure from his earlier statement regarding Gabapentin. I believe he was trying to recall specifics about his medication regimen and made an error in his previous response. To correct this, I'd like to note that my client has been taking Lyrica since May 20th of last year as part of his ongoing treatment plan for neuropathic pain, in addition to the Metformin and Glipizide for diabetes management.
ALJ: I acknowledge and affirm that Mr. Waters made an error in his previous statement regarding his medication regimen for neuropathic pain, which was corrected by his attorney to note that he started taking Lyrica on May 20th of last year as part of his ongoing treatment plan.
CLMT: It's like my bladder can't hold anything, and I get a constant feeling of needing to urinate. Sometimes I leak a little or have accidents.
ALJ: The record is closed.
ATTY: Garry Moen-Simonis, acknowledging the clarification on Mr. Waters' medication regimen and noting his current situation with urinary incontinence impacting daily activities and quality of life.
ALJ: Acknowledged.
ATTY: I'm done with my line of questioning.
ALJ: Can you clarify what you mean by '‘'unattended' when referring to Mr. Waters leaving the house?
ATTY: I meant that he requires constant supervision due to his severe urinary incontinence symptoms and would need to be accompanied by someone who can assist him if needed.
ALJ: So Mr. Waters requires constant supervision due to his urinary incontinence symptoms?
ATTY: Yes
ALJ: Does this constant supervision affect his ability to perform daily activities independently?
ATTY: Yes, Mr. Waters' constant supervision requirement Significantly impairs his ability to perform daily activities independently due to his urinary incontinence symptoms.
ALJ: You stated Mr. Waters requires constant supervision due to urinary incontinence symptoms. Does this mean he's not capable of using a restroom independently?
ATTY: Yes, Mr. Waters is currently unable to use a restroom independently due to his urinary incontinence symptoms.
ALJ: I appreciate the Claimant's testimony, thank you for sharing your experiences with us today.
ATTY: Garry 1S unable» ta. return .to work. due to Severe urinary incontinence symptoms and neuropathy.
ATTY: Dr. Legros' testimony supports the conclusion that Mr. Waters is unable to work independently due to his severe urinary incontinence symptoms and constant supervision
ALJ: [ INAUDIBLE]
ATTY: Garry Moen-Simonis, representing Claimant.
ATTY: iid .clike “to Glaritry that “Dr.f Legros” #previcus testimony stated that Mr. Waters' urinary incontinence symptoms are severe enough to prevent him from working independently, and constant supervision is required due to the severity of his condition... which, if I may ask, would you say is more accurate: 'severe', or perhaps even ‘extremely severe'? And, might I add, does this not imply that Mr. Waters' condition is, in fact, so debilitating as to render him unable to perform even the most basic tasks without assistance? And, I'd like to press a bit further, wouldn't it be fair to say that, given Dr. Legros' own words, Mr. Waters’ urinary incontinence symptoms are nothing short of ‘chronic and intractable', and thus, completely beyond his control?
ATTY: Thank you, Dr. Legros. Given that Mr. Waters' urinary incontinence symptoms are ‘extremely severe', 'chronic', and
ATTY: Does this mean Mr. Waters will require full- time assistance for the remainder of his life?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I'd like to press the issue further and ask if it's not true that Mr. Waters' urinary incontinence symptoms are so debilitating as to render him unable to even care for himself, much less perform any meaningful work or contribute to society in a significant way? And wouldn't you agree that this is essentially a life-long sentence of dependence on others for even the most basic needs, a fate that's surely more than a mere
ATTY: Dr. Legros, can you clarify whether Mr. Waters' condition would indeed render him a permanent and total burden on
ATTY: Dr. Legros, considering the severity and permanence of Mr. Waters' condition, do you not believe that he has crossed a threshold into a realm where even basic human dignity is no longer possible?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I*d Jike tow ask you this: Given Mr: Waters' complete loss of autonomy and dignity due to his urinary incontinence symptoms, do you think it's fair to say that he's been reduced to a mere shell of his former self, stripped of all hope for a meaningful existence?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I"d lake ‘to ask you this: If Mr. Waters" condition is indeed a catastrophic failure of the human body's ability to function even at its most basic level, doesn't that imply that he's been ravaged by some unseen force, leaving him a mere specter of his former self, barely clinging to existence?
ATTY: Dr. Legros, I believe we've thoroughly examined Mr. Waters' condition. I thank you for your expert opinion.
ATTY: I'd like to thank Dr. Legros for their comprehensive review of Mr. Waters' medical file and testimony. Given the overwhelming evidence presented, I firmly believe that we have established a clear case for permanent and total disability due to his urinary incontinence symptoms.
ALJ: VE Kutch, it appears that despite some accommodations for bathroom breaks as needed, Mr. Waters' urinary incontinence episodes would still pose a significant problem for his ability to work in Profile 2, a Customer Service Representative job. I'd like to note this conflictang opinion from our previous Conversation regarding the same occupation. Considering VE Kutch's testimony on both occasions, I find it reasonable to conclude that Mr. Waters' urinary incontinence symptoms would indeed significantly impair his ability to perform even modified or sedentary tasks. Counsel, do you have any questions for VE Kutch or myself before we proceed?
ATTY: VE Kutch's testimony has raised concerns about Mr. Waters' ability to perform even modified or sedentary tasks due to his urinary incontinence symptoms. I'd like to request that we reconsider the availability of jobs within the national economy that a person with these limitations could reasonably be expected to find and perform, given their transferable skills and abilities.
ALJ: Thank you, VE Kutch, for your thorough and thoughtful testimony on Mr. Waters' ability to perform various jobs despite his urinary incontinence episodes. It's clear that his condition would pose significant challenges to his job performance, relationships with coworkers, and career advancement. I'd like to summarize some key points from our discussion: Mr. Waters' frequent use of a catheter and need for bathroom breaks would likely cause him to be absent from work frequently, impacting his job performance and relationships with customers. His condition would also make it difficult for him to form close working relationships with coworkers, advance in his career, or take on leadership roles due to the stigma associated with his condition. Additionally, his frequent use of a catheter would affect his ability to participate in team- building activities, company- sponsored events, regular office meetings, and training sessions. VE Kutch, thank you again for your insights. Mr. Waters, do you have any final remarks or questions before we conclude this hearing?
CLMT: I'd like to take a moment to reflect on everything
ALJ: Thank you, VE Kutch and Mr. Waters, for your thoughtful testimony and insights today. I'd like to adjourn this hearing, but not before acknowledging the importance of breaking down stigmas surrounding disabilities in the workplace. We need to
CLMT: Thank you for today's hearing, I appreciate it.
ATTY: ~ Thank "you, VE) Kutch, for your thorough testimony. I appreciate the opportunity to represent Mr. Waters.
