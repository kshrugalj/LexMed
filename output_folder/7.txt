ALJ: Hulda Hoppe-Champlin: Good morning, everyone, I'd like to welcome you all to this live hearing, it's currently 11:00 AM on April 12th, 2023. We're about an hour ahead of schedule, and I appreciate your patience in that regard. As we speak, the time is actually 12:00 PM, or noon, according to standard timekeeping conventions. Claimant Jermaine Will, you've appeared before me today, personally, with your attorney Heloise Bernhard by your side. You're here regarding a matter of great importance, and I want to assure you that you are indeed entitled to this live hearing as stipulated in the relevant regulations. We have two expert witnesses joining us today, Dr. Alexanne Price, our medical expert, who, I might add, has an impressive background in orthopedic surgery with over 15 years of experience in her field... and Mr. Kieran Gerhold, our vocational expert, who, I'm told, is quite the avid hiker in his free time. With that said, Attorney Bernhard, can you confirm that your client has reviewed
ATTY: Yes, my client has reviewed the pre-hearing brief and is ready to proceed.
ALJ: I... uh, I believe Attorney Bernhard has just indicated that her client has indeed reviewed the pre- hearing brief and is ready to proceed as planned, yes, that's what she said. So, I'm going to repeat myself just to make sure everyone understands: we are all in agreement here, correct? The claimant has had a chance to review the material, and we're good to move forward with the hearing as scheduled, right? Okay... so, regarding the matter at hand, Mr. Will, I'd like to remind you that this live hearing is, of course, an optional format, and if you would prefer to participate in a video conference instead, we can certainly accommodate that request. This means the entire hearing would need to be reset, which could potentially add some extra time to our proceedings, but it's entirely up to you and what you're most comfortable with. So, I'd like to ask, Mr. Will, what are your preferences in this regard?
CLMT: I'm good with the live hearing as planned.
ALJ: Alright then, so Mr. Will has confirmed that he is good with proceeding as planned with the live hearing, yes, we're all set on that front. I'm glad we could clear that up. Now, let's take a look at some of the other materials we have before us today. We have the resumes of our expert witnesses, which I'd like to review briefly. Dr. Alexanne Price, our medical expert, has an

ALJ: I agree with Attorney Bernhard that the record is fully developed, and we don't need to add anything at this point. My notes indicate that all necessary materials have indeed been included, so I appreciate your diligence in ensuring a thorough review of the case. With that said, I'd like to admit all exhibits from 1A “down to 5D and Exhibit B=2, as indicated in. the -pre- hearing brief. This includes all medical records, expert witness reports, and other relevant documentation submitted by both parties.
ALJ: So, as I was saying earlier, we've reviewed all the materials and it seems that everything is indeed in order... or so it would appear at first glance. However, upon further review of
ATTY: Yes, ALJ, I believe there is a typographical error in the record. The correct date of my client's last hospitalization was indeed February 14th, not January 10th as initially stated. To amend the record accordingly, I would suggest adding a corrected Exhibit 3-D, which includes the updated medical records reflecting the accurate hospitalization date. This should be added to replace the existing Exhibit 3-D in the record.
ALJ: I understand that Attorney Bernhard wishes to amend the record by adding a corrected Exhibit 3-D, which includes updated medical records reflecting the accurate hospitalization date of February 14th. I'll make note of this request and proceed with the necessary steps to update the record accordingly. Claimant Will, are you aware that if we do indeed admit this amended exhibit, it may have some bearing on our overall
CLMT: Yes, I“mawate of that, Abu.
ALJ: I understand that we are amending the record to reflect the correct hospitalization date of February 14th, and I'd like to acknowledge that both Attorney Bernhard and Claimant Will are aware of the potential implications this may have on future proceedings. With that said, Hearing Reporter Lyric Nikolaus, please note that the record should be updated accordingly, with a corrected Exhibit 3-D reflecting the accurate hospitalization date.

ALJ: I acknowledge attorney's statement regarding
ATTY: Claimant's condition has worsened due to undue hardships.
ALJ: I'd like Attorney to clarify the connection between claimant's lack of access to accessible public transportation and therapy sessions and their worsening condition. Could you elaborate on how these undue hardships directly contributed to the exacerbation of symptoms?
ATTY: Lack of access to accessible public transportation
ALJ: How does claimant's inability to adhere to treatment plans impact their overall condition?
ATTY: It prevents symptom management and exacerbates chronic pain.
ALJ: You stated that claimant's inability to manage medication side effects is also an issue. How do these side effects impact their daily life?
ATTY: Medication side effects cause fatigue and increased pain, severely limiting daily activities.
ALJ: How does fatigue specifically impact claimant's ability to participate in daily activities?
ATTY: Claimant is unable to maintain a daily routine due to fatigue.
ALJ: af appreciate Claimant's summary of expected improvements with accessibility and accommodations. Reduced pain and improved mobility are indeed key outcomes. Dr. Alexanne Price, a renowned expert in disability medicine, has been called to provide further insight into claimant's condition. Her extensive background includes 15 years of experience in rehabilitation medicine and her work has been published in several reputable medical journals. For those interested in reviewing her qualifications, I can direct you to our website where her full resume is available for viewing. Attorney, do you have any objections to Dr. Price being considered as a medical expert?
ATTY: No objections.
ATTY: Dr. Price's testimony raises concerns about the effectiveness of Claimant's proposed accommodations and highlights the need for a more comprehensive treatment plan to address their musculoskeletal issues.
ALJ: Note taken.
ATTY: I'm Heloise Bernhard, Attorney for Claimant.
ATTY: Dr. Price, if a comprehensive treatment plan without immediate access to pain management and physical therapy would exacerbate Claimant's condition, wouldn't it stand to reason that
ATTY: Isn't Dr. Price's testimony essentially saying that Claimant's current lack of accommodations is causing harm, and Ehneretere,  doesn'ti te Logically follow that, granting ~chese accommodations would alleviate some of that harm?
ATTY: Dr. Price, you mentioned that Claimant's condition would likely require more comprehensive treatment than just accessibility and accommodations, but wouldn't it also be true to say that these measures could still provide some level of relief, even if temporary, for someone in such a vulnerable state? I mean, can we réally just dismiss the possibility that these accommodations might bring some comfort to Claimant when they're struggling with pain and mobility issues?
ATTY: Yes, exactly! Dr. Price, I understand that you've been a pioneer in rehabilitation medicine for over two decades, and I'm sure it's clear to you that Claimant's situation is far from ideal. But, 2f£ I may ask, don*t you think it's absolutely crucial that we consider the potential benefits of these proposed accommodations, even if they might not be the ultimate solution? I mean, wouldn't it be a gross oversight to dismiss their value entirely, especially when we're dealing with someone who's already
ATTY: Thank you, DE. Price, for acknowledging the importance of considering these accommodations, especially when we're dealing with someone who's already suffering so greatly. I mean, can't we agree that even if they might not be a panacea, they could at least provide some temporary respite from the pain and mobility issues that Claimant is facing? And wouldn't it be, well, almost cruel to dismiss their potential value entirely? I'm sure you'll agree with me that every little bit counts when we're talking about someone who's already in such a vulnerable state. Now, .eteme ask you this: Drs» Price, don't you think that the fact that: Claimant is able to prioritize self-care and alleviate medication side effects with these accommodations suggests that they might be more effective than you initially suggested? I mean, we're not talking about some kind of magic solution here, but rather a genuine attempt to improve their quality of life. So, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that these accommodations could, at the very least, provide some level of relief for Claimant?
ATTY: I'm satisfied with Dr. Price's testimony.
ATTY: With regard to exhibit 5-A and the primary care physician's support for the proposed accommodations, it seems that we now have multiple medical professionals agreeing on their potential effectiveness in providing temporary relief for Claimant. I'd like to reiterate the importance of considering these accommodations as a crucial step in alleviating Claimant's symptoms and improving their overall condition.
ALJ: The Vocational Expert's testimony suggests that Claimant may not be able to perform the duties of a Youth Minister due “to, their mobilaty issues.’ This information contradicts Dr. Price's earlier assessment regarding the proposed accommodations. T must consider this new evidence when making my decision. Counsel, do you have any questions for the record?
ATTY: No questions at this time.
ALJ: Thank you, Vocational Expert Kieran Gerhold, for your comprehensive testimony and thorough explanations regarding Claimant's employability as a Clergy Member. I'd like to summarize
CLMT: I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude for this opportunity to share my story and experiences with all of you today. As I stand before you, I want to emphasize that being disabled is not something to be ashamed of or hidden away. It's a part of who we are, and it deserves to be acknowledged and respected. I've faced numerous challenges in my journey as a Clergy Member, from navigating uneven terrain within an inaccessible worship space to managing my mobility issues on a daily basis. But despite these obstacles, I remain committed to serving my community with compassion, empathy, and understanding. I want to inspire you all today to see the world through the eyes of someone who is often overlooked or marginalized. To appreciate the small victories that come from perseverance and determination. And to recognize that our differences are not weaknesses, but rather unique strengths that enrich our lives and those around us. So let's break down these barriers together, shall we? Let's create a world where accessibility is not just a buzzword, but a reality that we strive for every day. A world where people with
ALJ: Thank you, Claimant, for your powerful testimony and heartfelt words. I appreciate your courage and resilience in sharing your experiences with us today. To both Dr. Price and Vocational Expert Kieran Gerhold, I extend my gratitude for their expert opinions and thorough explanations that have greatly aided our discussion. This meeting is now adjourned.
CLMT: Thank you for listening, I appreciate it.
